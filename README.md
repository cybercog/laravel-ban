## Installation

First, pull in the package through Composer:

```sh
$ composer require cybercog/laravel-ban
```

And then include the service provider within `app/config/app.php`:

```php
'providers' => [
    Cog\Laravel\Ban\Providers\BanServiceProvider::class,
],
```

At last you need to publish and run database migrations:

```sh
$ php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Cog\Laravel\Ban\Providers\BanServiceProvider" --tag="migrations"
$ php artisan migrate
```

## Usage

### Prepare bannable model

```php
use Cog\Contracts\Ban\Bannable as BannableContract;
use Cog\Laravel\Ban\Traits\Bannable;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

class User extends Authenticatable implements BannableContract
{
    use Bannable;
}
```

### Prepare bannable model database table

Bannable model must have `nullable timestamp` column named `banned_at`. This value used as flag and simplify checks if user was banned. If you are trying to make default Laravel User model to be bannable you can use example below.

#### Create a new migration file

```sh
$ php artisan make:migration add_banned_at_column_to_users_table
```

Then insert the following code into migration file:

```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

class AddBannedAtColumnToUsersTable extends Migration
{
    public function up()
    {
        Schema::table('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->timestamp('banned_at')->nullable();
        });
    }
    
    public function down()
    {
        Schema::table('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->dropColumn('banned_at');
        });
    }
}
```

### Available methods

#### Apply ban for the entity

```php
$user->ban();
```

#### Apply ban for the entity with reason comment
 
```php
$user->ban([
    'comment' => 'Enjoy your ban!',
]);
```

#### Apply ban for the entity which will be deleted over time
 
```php
$user->ban([
    'expired_at' => '2086-03-28 00:00:00',
]);
``` 

`expired_at` attribute could be `\Carbon\Carbon` instance or any string which could be parsed by `\Carbon\Carbon::parse($string)` method:

```php
$user->ban([
    'expired_at' => '+1 month',
]);
``` 

#### Remove ban from entity

```php
$user->unban();
```

On `unban` all related ban models are soft deletes.

#### Check if entity is banned

```php
$user->isBanned();
```

#### Check if entity is not banned

```php
$user->isNotBanned();
```

#### Delete expired bans manually

```php
app(\Cog\Laravel\Ban\Services\BanService::class)->deleteExpiredBans();
```

### Scopes

#### Get all models which are not banned

```php
$users = User::withoutBanned()->get();
```

#### Get banned and not banned models

```php
$users = User::withBanned()->get();
```

#### Get only banned models

```php
$users = User::onlyBanned()->get();
```

#### Scope auto-apply

To apply query scopes all the time you can define `shouldApplyBannedAtScope` method in bannable model. If method returns `true` all banned models will be hidden by default.

```php
use Cog\Contracts\Ban\Bannable as BannableContract;
use Cog\Laravel\Ban\Traits\Bannable;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

class User extends Authenticatable implements BannableContract
{
    use Bannable;
    
    /**
     * Determine if BannedAtScope should be applied by default.
     *
     * @return bool
     */
    public function shouldApplyBannedAtScope()
    {
        return true;
    }
}
```

### Events

If entity is banned `\Cog\Laravel\Ban\Events\ModelWasBanned` event is fired.

Is entity is unbanned `\Cog\Laravel\Ban\Events\ModelWasUnbanned` event is fired.

### Middleware

This package has route middleware designed to prevent banned users to go to protected routes.

To use it define new middleware in `$routeMiddleware` array of `app/Http/Kernel.php` file:

```php
protected $routeMiddleware = [
    'forbid-banned-user' => \Cog\Laravel\Ban\Http\Middleware\ForbidBannedUser::class,
]
```

Then use it in any routes and route groups you need to protect:

```php
Route::get('/', [
    'uses' => 'UsersController@profile',
    'middleware' => 'forbid-banned-user',
]);
```

### Scheduling

After you have performed the basic installation you can start using the `ban:delete-expired` command. In most cases you'll want to schedule these command so you don't have to manually run it everytime you need to delete expired bans and unban models.

The command can be scheduled in Laravel's console kernel, just like any other command.

```php
// app/Console/Kernel.php

protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
    $schedule->command('ban:delete-expired')->everyMinute();
}
```

Of course, the time used in the code above is just example. Adjust it to suit your own preferences.
